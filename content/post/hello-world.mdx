# Hello World!

Ta-da, here's my new website! I finally reached a point where I was satisfied with the final product. Way too much time was spent working on this site because (a) I wanted to style it in a way that suits me and (b) the entire thing was coded from scratch since I dislike templates.

I built the site using NextJS, a React framework. I'm using it with markdown to generate static Pages. In other words, it's pretty fast.

## Some features worth mentioning:

- Comment system using GitHub issues (utterances)
- MDX support for blog posts, like this one
- Support for clients without JavaScript
- Dark mode :)

The source code for this site is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Paranoia8972/static-blog)!

So, what's next?
Most of the content on here will be related to security, which may also include writeups for future events. If I have the time, I hope to write posts on a biweekly/monthly basis. I'm working on a few right now that I know a lot of people will enjoy!
